# Credit Scoring Model
### CodeAlpha Machine Learning Internship – Task 1

## 📖 Project Overview
This project builds a **Credit Scoring Model** using Machine Learning to predict
whether an individual is **creditworthy or not** based on financial and demographic data.
Such models are widely used in banking and financial institutions for loan approval decisions.

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict loan approval / creditworthiness
- Apply supervised machine learning classification techniques
- Evaluate model performance using industry-standard metrics

---

## 🗂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Credit Risk Dataset
- File: `credit_risk_dataset.csv`

### Features include:
- Personal and financial attributes
- Loan-related information
- Credit history details

### Target Variable:
- `loan_status`
  - `1` → Creditworthy
  - `0` → Not Creditworthy
